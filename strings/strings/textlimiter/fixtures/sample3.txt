This page contains Datasets and Test Collections related to the various research projects and papers associated with the Indexing Initiative project. In some cases, these are the complete Test Collections used including MEDLINE citations and any manually annotated results. In other cases, we provide PMIDs for the MEDLINE citations used in the experiments and it is up to the user to download these either from Entrez/PubMed or our MEDLINE Baseline Repository web sites. The packaging depends on what permissions we have been granted for releasing the data.
